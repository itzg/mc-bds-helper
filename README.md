# NO LONGER DEPLOYED

This project is no longer deployed and running on Vercel. They stopped my project due to overrunning the free tier, I make no money from these projects and can't afford to pay for ongoing deployment.

If you're experiencing this issue while using [itzg/minecraft-bedrock-server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-bedrock-server) image, then re-pull and re-apply the image. this bds helper endpoint was only provided during a grace period while users updated their images. Any issues reported about this endpoint will be closed.

You can always fork and deploy this project yourself on Vercel.

## Info
